Old blob layout

  header
    8 bytes
      1 byte transaction version (0)
      7 bytes parent offset
    8 bytes increment
  entry[]
    1-2 bytes key length (0 = end of list)
    1-32767 bytes key
    8 bytes data length
    0-(2^64-1) bytes data


New blob layout

  header
    1 byte transaction version (0)
    15 bytes transaction identifier (randomly generated during commit)
    8 bytes height/increment (must be 1 higher than that of highest parent)
    8 bytes parent offset [] (0 = end-of-list)
  entry[]
    1-2 bytes key length (0 = end of list)
    1-32767 bytes key
    8 bytes data length
    0-(2^64-1) bytes data

During GET of a certain key
  - Get the current heads, add to processing queue
  - Read keys of highest tx in queue
    - found -> return
  - Add parents of current tx in queue (deduplicate!, insert in-order)
  - Iterate, keep reading highest
  - Found root of storage, or tombstone = not found

Transaction sync idea (part of keveat, not kvsm):

  Nodes have predefined connections (--join <ip>:<port> on cli?)
    To start, just a tcp connection, newline-delimited messages
    We should maintain a lax approach to syncing data, as udp (future) may lose packets
      Hint: bittorrent-like request from multiple, packets declare what they are (like, "parents of I are H[]", instead of "response H[]")

  Node A requests current head list from node B
    Maybe request heads of null for "current" heads?
  B responds with current heads with their increments

  While received heads contain unknown identifiers:
    (A) requests parent list of identifier I
    (B) responds with I's parent identifiers
    (A) follows unknown parent path until all parents are known for I
    (A) requests contents of I (GET /api/v1/transactions/&lt;I&gt;/contents)
    (B) responds with contents
    (A) stores transaction, optionally updating it's own heads, keeping track of it's internal height

  Initially: Pulls 1 transaction per sync, schedule another sync if anything was pulled
  Eventually?: keep track of seen identifiers, pull all?
  Including height in sync ensures old data (from orphaned out-of-sync node) doesn't overwrite newer data
  Assumes all nodes in the network are trusted
  A received transaction must be rejected if it's height doesn't follow the always-incrementing rule
  chain root = null = virtual transaction without data, always matches between nodes

Compaction:

  Idea stays the same:

  Iterate every transaction in storage
  Keep transactions with reachable entries
  Discard transactions with no reachable entries (update surrounding pointers)
